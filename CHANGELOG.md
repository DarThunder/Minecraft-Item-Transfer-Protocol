## 0.8
### Features
- Added library `encryptLib`.
    - Added method `encryptAES()`.
    - Added method `decryptAES()`.
    - Added method `sha256()`.
    - Added method `generateSalt()`.
    - Added method `generateSecrets()`.
    - Added method `modExp()`.
- Added library `validatorLib`.
    - Added method `validateInput()`.
- Added method `depose()`
- Added method `sendRECV()`.
- Added method `sendNRECV()`.
- Added method `sendErrorResponse()`.
- Added new variable `lastAction`.
- Added new variable `secrets`.

### Changes
- Moved all validation logic to the `validatorLib` library.
- Modified the logic of the `await()` method.
- TCP and MITP messages now use SHA-256 signatures instead of a simple checksum.
- The Diffie-Hellman algorithm has been incorporated into the initial TCP handshake.
- The `buildMITPMessage()` function has been renamed to `buildMessage()`.
- The handling of TCP and MITP messages now works correctly for both client and server.
- Now, every correctly validated message will send a RECV flag, and in case of a validation failure, an NRECV flag will be sent.
- A mechanism to resend the last message in case of transmission malformation has been added.

### Known Issues
- We are currently investigating an issue where `shared_key` may not save correctly at the end of the TCP handshake, resulting in a nil value. We plan to resolve this issue in the next version.
- The `millerRabin()` algorithm occasionally takes longer than expected to verify if a number is prime, regardless of bit size. We are investigating the cause of this behavior and considering optimizing or completely replacing the algorithm.

### Fixes
- Minor fixes to improve the robustness of message validation and handling.

# Beta
## 0.4.7
#### Hey fellas, it's been a while since the last changelog, but here are the subtle changes and the transition to the beta version of the protocol.

## Changes
- Rewritten the main Ì£`MITP` module.
- Created subdirectory `lib/cipher`.
- Rewritten the `encryptLib module`.
- Created subdirectory `lib/compress`.
- Added `huffman` module.
- Added `huffmanTree` module.
- Added `huffmanNode` module.
- Created subdirectory `lib/network`.
- Added `client` module.
- Added `server` module.
- Added `socket` module.
- Added `Tcp` module.
- Created subdirectory `lib/utils`.
- Added `dataUtils` module.
- Rewritten the `validatorLib` module -> `validLib`.
- Created subdirectory `lib/var`.
- Added `client` module.
- Added `server` module.

## Improvements
- Changed the initialization of the actors (Client and Server), along with utility functions and required parameters (see Documentation for more details).
- Modified `AES-128 encryption`, now using the actual `Rijndael algorithm` instead of a simple XOR.
- Added a compression layer to messages using `Huffman encoding`.
- Changed the event system, along with the storage of status flags, which are now stored in the global table `_G.mitp.flags`.
- Modified the asynchronous system.
- Replaced session handling with socket-based communication.
- Changed the logic for data transmission and reception to emulate `TCP`.

## Fixes
- Fixed prime generation and primality testing with the `Miller-Rabin algorithm`.
- Fixed an issue with the `sha256` function that generated the same hash regardless of the input.
- Improved the overall stability of the system.

## Notes
#### Happy New Year, everyone! It's been a challenging year and months, but I managed to push this project forward. At one point, I decided to rewrite all the code in a moment of madness, and now we have all of this. Originally, the protocol was in the final stages of development, but it turns out there's still a long journey ahead. So, I'll see you in the next changelog!
