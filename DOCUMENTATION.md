# Minecraft Item Transfer Protocol (MITP) Documentation
## Overview
Minecraft Item Transfer Protocol (MITP) is a high-performance, secure communication protocol designed for ComputerCraft: Tweaked, facilitating item data transfers and general communication. It supports AES-128 encryption, SHA-256 hashing, HMAC authentication (No really WIP), and data compression using Huffman coding. MITP also includes asynchronous communication, similar to a TCP-like protocol, and an event-driven architecture for flexibility.

This documentation is aimed at developers looking to understand the protocolâ€™s architecture, how to interact with it, and how to integrate it into their Minecraft mods or applications.

## Download
To install the protocol and all its dependencies, simply paste the following command into a computer terminal:
```bash
wget run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DarThunder/Minecraft-Item-Transfer-Protocol/refs/heads/main/installer.lua
```
You will see the installation progress, and once it's finished, you can start using it without any issues.

## Architecture
MITP is designed with modularity and performance in mind. The protocol is divided into multiple components:

1. Core Protocol: Handles the main communication logic, including message creation, encryption, and data transfer.
2. Encryption: Uses AES-128 (Rijndael) for encryption and decryption, and SHA-256 for message integrity.
3. Compression: Implements Huffman coding to compress data before sending it, improving performance.
4. Network: Emulates a TCP-like communication model, supporting both client and server interactions.
5. Variables: A flexible event system that allows users to define custom events and handle them asynchronously.

## Components

### 1. MITP
The core of the protocol. It instantiates the two main actors: the client and the server. It also handles all events.

#### Example
```lua
local MITP = require("MITP")
local client = MITP.Client.new(1, 80)
local server = MITP.Server.new(80)
```

### 2. Client
The client is one of the main actors. It initializes the connection with the server, sending and receiving messages.

#### Methods
 - `2.1 Client:transmit()`
Allows the client to send messages to the server.

- Parameters:
    - payload: The message to send (can be any primitive data type, including tables).
    - flag?: (Optional) The type of flag to use.
- Returns:
    - true if the operation was successful.
    - false if something went wrong during transmission.

#### Example:
```lua
local success = client:transmit("Hello Server", "INFO")
if not success then
    print("Error transmitting the message.")
end
```

- `2.2 Client:recv()`
Allows the client to receive messages from the server.

- Parameters: None.

- Returns:
    - A table of type packet if the message was successfully received.
    - nil in case of an error.

#### Example:
```lua
local message = client:recv()
if message then
    print("Message received:", message.data.data)
else
    print("No message received.")
end
```

### 3. Server
The server is the other main actor, which is responsible for gathering information.

#### Methods
- `3.1 Server:on()`
Associates an action with a specified flag.

- Parameters:
    - flag: The flag to which the action will be applied.
    - action: The function that defines the action.

Example:
```lua
server:on("INFO", function(conn, packet)
    print("Received:", packet.data.data)
    conn:send("Response from the server")
end)
```

- `3.2 Server:autoRecv()`
Handles incoming requests. It is typically added at the end of the program.

- Parameters: None.

- Returns: None.

Example:
```lua
server:autoRecv()
```

### 4. Connection
Although there are only two main actors, the Server has the characteristic that the function used in the on method has another sub-actor called "connection," which is the socket that will be used to communicate with a specific client.

#### Methods
- `4.1 Conn:send()`
Allows sending messages to a specific client.

- Parameters:
    - payload: The message to send (can be any primitive data type, including tables).

- Returns:
    - true if the operation was successful.
    - false if something went wrong during the message sending.

Example:
```lua
local success = conn:send("Hello client!")
if not success then
  print("Error sending the message.")
end
```
